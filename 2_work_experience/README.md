### Can you please explain in detail the work experience over the last three years. What kind of technology, what kind of solution, what kind of difficulties did you face? What was the work procedure you did?

### Cloud Engineer

As a cloud engineer, I was exposed with AWS breadth of solutions and services. Also, this is where I explored more of containers and container orchestration using Kubernetes.

> Technologies Used:

1. AWS, Azure and Alibaba Cloud
2. Terraform, Ansible and Cloudformation
3. Docker and Kubernetes
4. GitLab and Jenkins
5. Container Orchestrator Platform: ECS, EKS, TKGI

> Difficulties Encountered:

1. Manual deployment of infra components

> To address the above challenges, we do deployment via Cloudformation templates. Templates created were stored in GitLab and the deployment is via Jenkins. This way we can standardize the infra provisioning.

### Software Engineer

As a software engineer, I started as a low-code developer but eventually moves to backend development using serveless framework. This is where I started exploring AWS.

> Technologies Used:

1. NodeJS (Backend) and ReactJS (Frontend)
2. Serverless Framework (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, etc.)
3. VUI with AWS Alexa

> Solutions Created:

1. Timesheet Middleware (SE)
2. AWS Alexa skill for a pharmaceutical company (SE)
3. Bulk query tool for a telco company (SE)
